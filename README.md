## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub repository! Iâ€™m a machine learning engineer using PyTorch Lightning to accelerate and organize the development of high-performance ML models. This repository highlights my approach to building scalable, modular, and reproducible workflows with a strong focus on clean code structure, hyperparameter tuning, and experiment reproducibility.

PyTorch Lightning abstracts much of the boilerplate in traditional PyTorch projects, allowing developers to focus on the core logic of model training and evaluation. I use it to streamline research and deployment workflows while maintaining flexibility and control over every part of the pipeline.

Structured Code: Each project in this repository follows Lightning's best practices for separating concernsâ€”defining models, data loaders, and training loops in modular components. This results in code thatâ€™s easier to debug, extend, and scale across multiple GPUs or nodes without modification.

Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimizing model performance is critical, and this repo includes examples of integrating tools like Optuna and Ray Tune with PyTorch Lightning for automated hyperparameter searches. Configuration management is handled through argparse, yaml, or Hydra, making it simple to track and replicate experiments.

Reproducibility: I place a strong emphasis on reproducibility. Every project is configured with fixed random seeds, version-controlled dependencies, and structured logging using tools like TensorBoard, Weights & Biases, or MLflow. This ensures that results can be reliably traced and validated.

This repository is ideal for ML researchers, engineers, and data scientists who want to scale their model development workflows while maintaining clarity and consistency. It includes detailed documentation, setup instructions, and example notebooks to help you get started quickly.

Feel free to explore, fork, or contributeâ€”organized machine learning starts here.
